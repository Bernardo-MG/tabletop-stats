/**
 * Extension of {@link ValueBox} for skills.
 * <p>
 * Additionally to what the base interface offers, this one allows indicating a
 * name and a descriptor with the methods inherited from {@link Skill}. Of
 * course, this can also be used for named values, in which case the descriptor
 * can be hidden on the actual implementation, by inheriting this class through
 * composition.
 * <p>
 * Note that most of the times a simple {@code ValueBox} will be enough for any
 * model. If there is only a set number of values use the basic {@code ValueBox}
 * , if the number of values can change, use this interface.
 * <p>
 * Another way to see this is that if the values have to be stored in a
 * collection, then they may be represented by this interface. If you can set a
 * getter for each value on a class, then the basic {@code ValueBox} is enough.
 * <p>
 * Note that for those cases where the value just needs a name this interface
 * may also be used. Just ignore the descriptor.
