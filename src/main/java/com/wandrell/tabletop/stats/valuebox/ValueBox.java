/**
 * Interface wrapping a value to allow listening to changes on it. This serves
 * to link the value to other classes, to implement logic such as that of
 * derived attributes.
 * <p>
 * A less abstract way of understanding the objective of this interface is that
 * it represents those values which are noted inside boxes on a character sheet.
 * That's the reason actually for the class' name.
 * <p>
 * It should be noted that if it is used for handling derived attributes then
 * the {@link #setValue(Integer) setValue} method should be disabled, or just
 * empty.
 * <p>
 * The recommended way of handling this is actually hiding implementations of
 * {@code ValueBox} inside a class, so they can't be accessed directly, even
 * when they are meant to be editable.
 * <p>
 * For example, if implementations of this interface are used to represent the
 * attributes of a character, then the class representing that character will
 * have a setter and getter for each attribute, and those method will call the
 * instances of {@code ValueBox}.
