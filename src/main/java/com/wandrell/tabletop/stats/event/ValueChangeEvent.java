/**
 * {@code EventObject} storing the status of a value related event.
 * <p>
 * This is sent when a, {@code Integer} field has been modified, and will store
 * both the old and the new values of such field.
 * <p>
 * Note that the old value is the one the field has before the event happens,
 * while the new is the one that same field has after the event has happened.
 * The values on this event should be consistent with that.
 * <p>
 * Also, keeping these two values means the event can represent any change, no
 * matter if the value increased or decreased, that can be found out by checking
 * the values.
 * <p>
 * The main use of this event is handling changes made to a
 * {@link com.wandrell.tabletop.stats.valuebox.ValueBox ValueBox}, so any other
 * {@code ValueBox} which derives from it can update it's own value.
