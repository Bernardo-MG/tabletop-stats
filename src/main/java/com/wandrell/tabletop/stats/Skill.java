package com.wandrell.tabletop.stats;

/**
 * Interface for representing a stat with a name and descriptor. These usually
 * are related to RPG skills, which are identified by a unique combination of a
 * name and a descriptor.
 * <p>
 * The name indicates the general domain of the skill, while the descriptor
 * refers to a concrete variant.
 * <p>
 * For example languages in RPGs are usually represented in way similar to
 * "Language (English)", or "Language (Latin)", where "English" and "Latin" are
 * the descriptors and "Language" the name.
 * <p>
 * Another important characteristic of these stats, which is implied by the
 * previous fact, is that the number of them is variable and unpredictable.
 * <p>
 * Going back to the same example, while attributes are usually a set number,
 * there is always the possibility of adding new skills to any model.
 * <p>
 * For those cases where a value should be handled along the identifiers, the
 * {@link com.wandrell.tabletop.stats.valuebox.SkillBox SkillBox} interface
 * should be used.
